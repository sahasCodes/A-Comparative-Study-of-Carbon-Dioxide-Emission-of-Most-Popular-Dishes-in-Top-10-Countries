# Environmental Impact Analysis

This project analyzes the environmental impact of different dishes based on greenhouse gas emissions. The dataset includes information about various ingredients and their corresponding emissions per kilogram.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environmental-impact-analysis.git
    cd environmental-impact-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main_script.py
    ```

2. Explore the visualizations and analysis generated.

## Files and Directories

- `main_script.py`: The main Python script for data processing and visualization.
- `Datasets/`: Directory containing input datasets.
- `Results/`: Directory containing the generated visualizations and analysis results.

## Visualizations

- **Heatmap:** Shows the correlation matrix of emissions for different dishes and countries.
